        nameFact:"The first book ever written",
        description:"The only natural interesting fact about reading to get us started is where it all began. As far as historians can tell, the first book ever written was the Epic of Gilgamesh. An epic poem dating back thousands of years, it was written in ancient Mesopotamia around the year 2100 BCE. It consists of twelve clay tablets and was discovered in the ruins of the Ashurbanipal library in 1853. It tells the story of the hero king of Uruk and is believed by many to have been an inspiration for some of Homer’s writings. While this book dates back thousands of years, where things really changed for books as we know them was the year 1454. That is when a brilliant German man called Johannes Gutenberg managed to build the world’s first printing press. Almost overnight, everything changed in terms of book printing and this was the first step toward us having access to millions of titles printed ever since. "

        description:"While a bestseller may sound like something rather modern, originating from recent times when literature has become more of an industry than a form of art, the truth is that the term “bestseller” dates back to 1889 and was used in Alice Brown’s book “Fools of Nature”. "

        nameFact:"People from Iceland are avid readers",
        description:"While most of us connect Iceland to its Viking past more than anything else, the truth is that the population in Iceland is actually a lot more refined, civilized, and intellectual than any of us might expect. Their Viking days are long gone, and they are today an example for all of us. When it comes to reading, certain statistics suggest that they might be the most avid readers in the world.50% of Icelanders read more than 8 books per year, while 93% of them read at least one. This may have something to do with their traditions. The most relevant one is their Christmas tradition of gifting each other books. Not only that, but they also have the habit of actually spending the Christmas evening reading together and eating chocolate. That’s a tradition we can certainly get behind at Basmo. As a matter of fact, most of our nights are surprisingly similar to the Icelandic Christmas."

        nameFact:"Fairy Tales are for grown ups",
        description:"Don’t tell Disney, but fairy tales aren’t actually for the kids. These tales have origins in the oral stories of thousands of years ago. People would share stories, or even act them out with their own variations thrown in, to either entertain or inform. The creating of tales even became a famous parlor game in the 17th century and eventually, writers like the Brothers Grimm began to document the stories in books.These tales from all over the world do have universal themes, but are often rather gruesome and contain harsh lessons. Over the years, fairy tales have come to be more associated with children and “happily ever after” than as the cautionary tales of old. Even now, fairy tales are getting revamped. Want a fresh take on a fantasy world? The Hazel Wood by Melissa Albert follows Alice into a world that she thought her grandmother had made up to sell books but it turns out it, and the creatures in it, are very real."
